**Photometric Stereo Training Data Set with Annotated Leaf Masks** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the biological and genetic research. 

The dataset consists of 4818 images with 33154 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*leaf*).

Images in the Photometric Stereo Leafs dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (3492 images) and *train* (1326 images). Decomposed multi-channel *train* images are grouped by unique ***im_id*** into 221 groups with 6 layers each: ***Albedo images***, ***Surface normal map images***, ***Grayscale images***, ***Shadow images***, ***Composite images***, and ***Foreground_Background images***. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 4 test images layers: ***Binary masks*** (873 images), ***CroppedAlbedo*** (873 images), ***CroppedComposite*** (873 images), and ***CroppedGrayscale*** (873 images). Additionally, images metadata contains information about ***leaf number***, ***plant number***, ***lights***, ***region of interest***, ***days after germination***,***interval between imaging***, ***growth light intensity***, ***growth temperature***, and the ***growth light intensity***. The dataset was released in 2019 by the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.
