**Photometric stereo training data set with annotated leaf masks** is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the agriculture industry.

The dataset consists of 221 images with 2433 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (_leaf_).

Each image in the Photometric stereo leafs dataset has pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: _ds_ (221 images). The dataset was released in 2019.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 1 classes:
